### **SIX** **ADJUST SERVO FOR ASSEMBLY**


Before assembling the servo, it is essential to set the angle to zero. Since servo motors have a limited range of motion,
setting the angle to zero degrees ensures that the servo starts in its initial position and avoids exceeding its range when
powered on. Failing to set the servo to zero beforehand may cause it to attempt to move beyond its allowed range
when powered, potentially damaging both the servo and the mechanical system it’s attached to. This step is crucial to
guarantee safe and proper operation of the servo motor.
